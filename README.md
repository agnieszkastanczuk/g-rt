# Form with Ballerina API and Angular Frontend

This project consists of two main parts:

1. A Backend API in Ballerina for managing users.
2. A Frontend in Angular utilizing Angular Material.

I did this project as a recruitment assignment and it is one of my first projects using Angular. Wish me luck :flushed:

## Requirements

- Ballerina
- Node.js and npm
- Angular CLI

## Running the Project

### Starting the Backend API

To run the Backend API, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the API backend directory:  
   `cd 01-users-api`
3. Start the Ballerina server:
   `bal run`
   The API server should now be running on `http://localhost:8080`.

### Starting the Frontend

To start the frontend application, follow these steps:

1. Open a new terminal window.
2. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   `cd 02-frontend/login-form`
3. Install npm dependencies:
   `npm install`
4. Start the Angular development server:
   `ng serve --open`
   The frontend application should automatically open in your browser at `http://localhost:4200`.
